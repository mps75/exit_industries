Hello friend.  (haha, see what I did there?)  I recently finished watching all four seasons of Mr. Robot and just wanted to write a quick note about it.  When I [last mentioned]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-01-08-show-update %}) this I was about done with the second season and, honestly, was on the verge of being annoyed with some aspects of the story line.  I gotta say, though, the third season is damn near perfect and the fourth isn't far behind.  I'm not really qualified to analyze TV shows or movies so take all this with a grain of salt, but here are a few things I think are remarkable about the show.

I already mentioned how the show's tech realism is something you just don't ever see in really any movie or TV show.  It's not perfect and I think there are quite a few details that get glossed over to keep the story moving.  But, it's refreshing that they at least tried to make it realistic.  I think I'll always really love that aspect of the show.

The other really big thing for me is the way the show is shot.  The camera angles and placement are just so creative and I think gives the show its distinct "vibe."  And the music is always spot-on.  Lastly, and I don't really know what the jargon is for this type of thing, but it seems like most of the scenes are given the space they require to flesh out the emotions or intensity of what's happening.  Scenes aren't rushed and the characters are given the time it takes to really dig in to what's happening both externally and internally.  Most scenes with White Rose are this way.  And the critical scene with Vera, Krista, and Elliot is also given the room required to convey the depth and intensity of what's happening.

Of course this isn't a complete list of what makes the show amazing, just a few short observations.  I'm sad I'm done watching it.  Some day I'll probably go back and rewatch seasons 3 and 4 since they are just so damn perfect.  If you haven't had a chance to watch Mr Robot, I highly recommend it.
