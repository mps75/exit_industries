In the beginning of March I decided I finally wanted to start learning [Swift](https://swift.org) and perhaps ultimately create some macOS or iOS apps, just for fun.  I went to the [Swift subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) and started poking around, trying to figure out the best place to start.  The free [100 days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) online course was on the top of the recommended list for noobs so that’s what I started.

As I write this I’m currently on day 22 of the course and so far it’s been a lot of fun.  The first 15 days are a crash-course in the basics of the Swift language.  While I wouldn’t call myself a developer, over the years I’ve written a fair number of scripts in Python, Ruby, and Powershell so I’m familiar with programming constructs like variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, etc.  I’m 100% new to Swift, though, so while most of the concepts in the first couple weeks of the course weren’t exactly new, the implementation details were.  And there were definitely some concepts that were new to me like protocols, extensions, and optionals.  (And maybe closures.  Ruby has blocks, procs, and lambdas, which are considered closures and I’ve used those, but felt like I needed a refresher for sure. )  Those first couple weeks were a nice way to get started and get back in the programming mindset.

I was honestly a little worried about the switch to SwiftUI, which is the newest user interface framework for Swift.  It provides the graphical components that allow you to create iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS apps.  All of the programming I’ve ever really done (except web sites) has been on console apps (i.e, command-line programs) so I don’t have experience creating full-blown GUIs.  It’s been really fun, though, learning how SwiftUI works.  I’m only a couple lessons in, however, so just scratching the surface at this point.  I’ve come across some questions and answers on Stack Exchange that  tell me I’ll probably be over my head soon.  But, I’m doing for fun so will take it slow and enjoy the trip.
