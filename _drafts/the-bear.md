One of my favorite shows in the last few years is [The Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)).  I don’t think I’m alone because it’s won a bunch of awards and accolades, all well-deserved.  In addition to the amazing acting, writing, and cinematography, I find the subject matter to be extremely compelling.  Although maybe not in the way most people do.  At least it’s not mentioned in many of the takes of seen on YouTube or what I've read in various articles.

Most people comment about how realistic the show is.  Unfortunately I’ve never worked in the food industry so I can’t comment on that.  But, as mentioned, the general consensus from folks who know is that the authenticity of the kitchen scenes -- the culture, the characters, the lingo, the physical and mental pressures -- are all legit.

What I find most interesting, though, is the culture of perfection at high-end restaurants.  I read [Unreasonable Hospitality](https://www.amazon.com/Unreasonable-Hospitality-Remarkable-Giving-People/dp/0593418573) last year after watching season 2 of The Bear and it gives more details about what it takes to get a Michelin star (or stars).  I find it really weird, though, that I’m so interested in this, yet have zero desire to actually dine at any of these places.  Perhaps now that [Eleven Madison Park](https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com) is plant-based.  But, I don’t think I’d ever be able to justify the cost.  Who knows, though, maybe some day.

Back to the point.  I worked at a Fortune 100 tech company for 17 years.  It wasn’t exactly the pinnacle of high-tech, Silicon Valley, but it also wasn’t a shitty mom-and-pop, either.  However, in my 17 years I can’t say I was ever in a single situation where I was overwhelmed with a team’s “level of perfection.”  I don’t want to come off like a snob here because our team was the same.  Sloppy at times, working to the level of “good enough” and, for the most part, hitting that target.  But still, lots of shoulder shrugging.  And there’s probably a good reason everyone at that particular company, and people in most companies, work at that level: the effort required to move the needle from, say, 95% to 99.9% just isn’t worth the gains.

I also think there’s some type of defense mechanism at play.  It’s either the “cool kids don’t care” syndrome or something related where if you totally commit to caring 100% about your craft, you open yourself up to a lot of disappointment and heartache.  And mental health issues, like The Bear highlights.  Yet there’s still something alluring about striving for a level of perfection that’s utterly unreasonable.  Like *really* committing to something, showing it’s actually cool to care and that you’ve thought about all the details and have your shit *completely* dialed in.  Every meeting has an agenda.  People are prepared, present, and engaged in these meetings.  Documentation is 100% complete and accurate.  There's not a piece of lab equipment out of place.  Everyone is unified and working toward the same goals.  Tape is cut, not torn.

While *The Original Beef of Chicagoland* certainly doesn't capture this ethos at the start of the show, Carmen and Sydney do.  The other restaurants featured in the show do.  I think it's also fair to say the actors, writers, cinematographers, and editors of the show itself are working at an insanely high standard and that's what makes the show so amazing.
