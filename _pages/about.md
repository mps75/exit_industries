It's 2023.  Aside from [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org) is anyone still blogging?  Facebook and Instagram lost their appeal for me a while ago and Twitter is, well, everyone knows what's happening there.  I've been missing having a place to post random stuff so I thought I'd try my hand at blogging again.  I enjoy fiddling with Jekyll and CSS probably as much (or more) as I do creating the content.  So we'll see how things go.  At the very least, it's been a fun project getting this site up and running.

At the moment I'm obsessed with sim racing so I'll probably be posting a lot of stuff about that.  I'm also into bikes, guitars, camping, and video games so those things could show up here as well.

Thanks a lot for reading.
