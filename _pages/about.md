Hi.  My name is Matthew Swanson -- welcome to my blog.

I used to live in Southern California and work in IT.  Now I live in Idaho and spend most of my time on my hobbies.  I’m currently into riding bikes, camping, practicing guitar, watching moves/TV, reading, and playing video games.

It seems weird to work on a blog these days, but last year I started to really miss having a small web project like this so I decided to scrap most of my old, stale blog and start something new.  I really enjoy fiddling with Jekyll and CSS and all the other pieces it takes to pull together a site (probably more than I like actually writing posts).  So it’s been fun to get something new up and running.

Speaking of the site, it's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).  I used the [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme as a starting point, but have modified it heavily to meet my needs.

Thanks for visiting.
