Hi.  My name is Matthew Swanson -- welcome to my blog.

It seems weird to work on a blog these days, but last year I started to really miss having a small web project like this so I decided to scrap my old, stale blog and start something new.  I really enjoy fiddling with Jekyll and CSS and all the other pieces it takes to pull together a site (probably more than I like actually writing posts).  So it’s been fun to get something new up and running.

As for me, I used to live in Southern California and work in IT.  Now I live in Idaho and work on my hobbies.  I’m currently into riding bikes, camping, practicing guitar, watching stuff, reading stuff, and playing video games.

Thanks for visiting.
