We've been watching _Archive 81_ on Netflix the past few nights and it's pretty good.  I wouldn't say it's the most amazing show ever, but it's creepy AF at times and has been pretty fun to watch.

I've also been re-watching the first couple seasons of _Mr. Robot_ to refresh my memory so I can finish the rest of the series.  I love the hacking/computer stuff since it's probably one of the only shows where that's actually pretty realistic.  Maybe some of it isn't super feasible, but at least they're talking about real technologies/techniques.  The writers seem to have involved people that actually know tech so it's refreshing to not see the usual, "I'm in" bullshit where the hacker is flying around in three dimensional systems.  (Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX4oAXpvUE) -- so stupid.)  I will say the, "I'm talking to dead people all the time" stuff is getting a little old, especially on the second viewing.  I've read the last season is really good so that's keeping me excited to keep watching.
