Tuesday night was the second race of the NASRS season 14.  The race (65 minutes, one mandatory pit stop) was at Brands Hatch and I qualified P10 out of 37, which was a little better than I thought I'd end up.  Brands is a very tricky track and it takes almost 100% concentration for the entire lap.  Any small mistake or loss of focus will cause, at best, a second lost or, at worst, a spin out.  I had a decent start and was able to get into 8th for most of the first stint.  I had some good battles so it was intense, but a lot of fun.  I got hit going into the pits and almost lost it, but was able to recover with only minor damage.

The second stint was even more intense than the first as I was battling with a driver for over 20 laps.  It was such good fun.  I got into a big tangle on the last lap and the other driver had a major spin out.  I think it was his fault, but haven't seen the final stewards report so I might have an incoming penalty (hopefully not).  Anyway, another fun race with a decent result -- P6 out of 37.  Looking forward to next week's race at Zolder.
