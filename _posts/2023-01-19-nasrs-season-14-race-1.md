Tuesday night was the first race of the NASRS season 14.  Things are a bit different this season as there are only 3 splits -- Tuesday night, Wednesday night, and rookies on Thursday night.  In the past there were bronze, silver, and gold splits, but all of those have been consolidated into just two splits.  The weather is a bit more dynamic on Wednesday, but otherwise there's no real skill difference between Tuesday and Wednesday -- it really just depends on what night works best for folks.

The race was at Imola and I qualified P8 out of 50, which was a bit better than my actual skill level suggests.  This is probably due to the fact that I'm driving the Aston Martin, which is pretty strong at Imola.  I got lucky and finished the race in P4, which is a lot better than I was expecting.  The start of the race was a little sketchy.  I didn't get a great start and banged doors a bit with the guy behind me, but nothing bad came of that for either of us.  I did, however, get caught up a bit in a collision a few turns into lap 1, which set me back into P10.  I was able to work my way back up to P5 and gained one more spot after the leader got a late 10 second penalty.  I t-boned someone who spun out very late in the race, but thankfully I was still able to finish without any issues.

I'm really happy with how I drove and how the race played out.  It was a pretty intense 65 minutes -- looking forward to next week's race at Brands Hatch.
